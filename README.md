Sum product networks are a variant of deep neural networks that has better semantics and they are simple as compared to other models. 
This a growing research area and this project brings in expanding domains for sum product networks
The PIMA indian diabetics dataset from kaggle has been used in this project. 
The outcome is 1 or 0 which means whether a patient has diabetics or not.
